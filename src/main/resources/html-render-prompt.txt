Represent the API response in HTML to display the results to a user. The HTML should use Vue3 and import the response JSON file called 'response.json'. The mounted method to load the response data looks like this:
```javascript
async mounted() {
            try {
                const response = await fetch('response.json');
                if (!response.ok) {
                    throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
                }
                this.jsonData = await response.json();
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error);
            }
        }
```

My HTML looks like this so far:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>###FILL THIS OUT###</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
</head>
<body>
<div id="app">
###FILL THIS OUT###
</body>
</html>
```

Fill out the ###FILL THIS OUT### parts and use the async mounted method I provided.
Provide fully functional code.
Make sure variables that are needed to render the HTML are not null since the data is loaded asynchronously.
Respond only with the finished code, no explanation before or after the code.
